# City-Explorer-API

**Author**: Johnny Backus
**Version**: 1.7.3 (I lost count)
**API keys**: see env.sample

## Overview

This project is our first exposure to full stack web development. The front end will be built with Vite React and Bootstrap components and deployed by netlify.com. The server will be built using node.js and hosted on render.com.

## Getting Started

For this project we will be making API calls from our server, processing the information remotely before returning it to our front-end.

Here is a photo-realistic representation of this process we call the Web Request-Response Cycle...

## Change Log

12.5.23: First real API call made directly from front end to location service.
12.6.23: Location data passed to local server to retrieve additional data from external APIs, process, and return to front end.
12.7.23: Front end and back end fully deployed from remote hosting services.

## Credit and Collaborations

Much help received from TAs Brandon, Tammy, and Kjell. Also from Instructor John.
ChatGPT had several helpful (and some not-so-helpful) hints (the first conversation was from a group warm up code exercise and was unrelated to this project): https://chat.openai.com/share/6f8f03cb-89c9-46f2-b817-f152a3290c40

## Time Estimates

For each of the lab features, make an estimate of the time it will take you to complete the feature, and record your start and finish times for that feature:
